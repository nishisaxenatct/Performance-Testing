Correlation:
Correlation is used to handle the dynamic values in script. Dynamic values can we changed for each user action or for different value.
in both cases correlation take care of these values and prevents them from failing the script during execution.
Dynamic value is two type

1. Static: where Left boundary and right boundary is static
2. Dynamic: where LB and RB is also changed

1. Manual correlation:
1. Determine the value to capture
2. find the rigt and left boundaries of the value to capture
3. find which occurance of the text boundaries should be used
4. Add a new step> goto the navigatore>search> Web_reg_save_param_regexp> drag where you want to add> add parameter name>RegExp>LB and RB and occurance of the function

5.
